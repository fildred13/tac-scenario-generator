## Development Environment

This project uses poetry for dependency management. First, install poetry
according to the poetry documentation. Then execute the following command to
install all project dependencies.

```bash
poetry install
```

See the poetry documentation for more information about adding and updating
dependencies.

The only other tool which must be installed on the host system is `tox` for
running unit tests and linting. Install tox, and run the tests and lint with:

```bash
poetry run tox
```
